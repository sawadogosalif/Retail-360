Feature engineering is a skill every data scientist should know how to perform, especially in the case of time series
The key to the top is always feature engineering, and it is not something taught in tutorials, books, or courses. 
It is all about creativity, experience, and domain knowledge.
Time Series is often considered a difficult topic to master. 
That’s understandable because there are a lot of moving parts when we’re working with the date and time components.
But once you have a hang of the basic concepts and are able to perform feature engineering, you’ll be gliding through your projects in no time
