## Pareto Analysis
The Pareto Principle is very simple, yet very important. 
It is named after Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who, in 1906, found that 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population.

What was most important about Paretoâ€™s finding was that this 80/20 distribution occurs extremely frequently. For example, in general, 20% of your customers represent 80% of your sales. And 20% of your time produces 80% of your results.
Here, let's try others approch : cumulative  sales for 20% 40% 60% 80%
